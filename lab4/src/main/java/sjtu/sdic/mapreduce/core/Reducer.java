     * 
     * 	doReduce manages one reduce task: it should read the intermediate
     * 	files for the task, sort the intermediate key/value pairs by key,
     * 	call the user-defined reduce function {@code reduceF} for each key,
     * 	and write reduceF's output to disk.
     * 	
     * 	You'll need to read one intermediate file from each map task;
     * 	{@code reduceName(jobName, m, reduceTask)} yields the file
     * 	name from map task m.
     *
     * 	Your {@code doMap()} encoded the key/value pairs in the intermediate
     * 	files, so you will need to decode them. If you used JSON, you can refer
     * 	to related docs to know how to decode.
     * 	
     *  In the original paper, sorting is optional but helpful. Here you are
     *  also required to do sorting. Lib is allowed.
     * 	
     * 	{@code reduceF()} is the application's reduce function. You should
     * 	call it once per distinct key, with a slice of all the values
     * 	for that key. {@code reduceF()} returns the reduced value for that
     * 	key.
     * 	
     * 	You should write the reduce output as JSON encoded KeyValue
     * 	objects to the file named outFile. We require you to use JSON
     * 	because that is what the merger than combines the output
     * 	from all the reduce tasks expects. There is nothing special about
     * 	JSON -- it is just the marshalling format we chose to use.
     * 	
     * 	Your code here (Part I).
